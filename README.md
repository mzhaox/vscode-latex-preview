![Screenshot](media/screenshot.png)

## Features

* Inline preview of LaTeX documents, automatically updated on save.
* Generate VSCode build tasks for LaTeX documents.
* Click on a document position to go to the relevant source code.
* Use a context menu item to go from source code to a preview document position.

## Usage

Open a `.tex` file, and then click the "Open Preview" button in the title bar. This will open a preview rendering which
is updated when you save the document. To go from a source code location to a preview location, select "Show in Preview"
in the editor context menu. You can also click on the preview document to go to the corresponding source code. If you
want to use xetex or latexmk to generate your preview you can change the `latex-preview.command` config option.

For BibTeX support, it is recommended to set `latex-preview.command` to `latexmk`, which will use latexmk to run the
required bibtex commands. On Windows, you will need to ensure that Perl is installed for latexmk support.

To generate a VSCode build task to run `pdflatex`, run the "LaTeX: Create Build Task" command.

## Commands

* **LaTeX: Create Build Task** Prompts to select a `.tex` file and creates a task in `tasks.json` to build it using `pdflatex`.
* **LaTeX: Show Preview** Opens a preview of the current document in a new tab. The preview updates when the document is saved.
* **LaTeX: Show Preview to Side** Opens a preview in a column alongside the current document.
* **LaTeX: Show in Preview** Jumps to the current cursor position in the preview document.
* **LaTeX: Show Source** Shows the source document for the current preview.
* **LaTeX: Show Preview Compile Output** Shows an output channel with the latex preview compile output.
